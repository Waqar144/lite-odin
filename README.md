## Intro

This is a port of https://github.com/rxi/lite/ to Odin which I did while learning Odin language. It should be more or less the same as the original editor, the plugins should work (though I haven't really tried them yet). It uses lua 5.4 instead of 5.2

Included is a main.zig file which I did for comparison of both languages.
